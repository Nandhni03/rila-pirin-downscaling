Custom batched ERA5 fetch for multi-year TopoPyScale runs.

TopoPyScale's own fetch_era5.py (retrieve_era5 / era5_request_surf / era5_request_plev)
issues one CDS API request PER DAY. That's fine for a one/two-day validation
run, but impractical at multi-year scale: 1980-2025 is ~16,800 days x 2
datasets (surf, plev) = ~33,600 individual requests, which risks CDS
rate-limiting/throttling independent of actual compute cost.

Empirically found (2026-09-29 pilot, see PROGRESS.md/logs.md) that CDS's
per-request "cost" limit for PLEV sits below a full calendar month
(~62,500 fields: 6 vars x 14 levels x 744h -- rejected outright with "403
cost limits exceeded") and even below a 7-day chunk (~14,112 fields --
also rejected). Our only previously-proven-safe PLEV request was actually a
single DAY (2,016 fields: 6 vars x 14 levels x 24h, from the original
2022-11-27/28 validation run -- note that run's "2 days" was always two
separate 1-day requests, never tested combined). 3-day chunks (~6,048
fields) DID succeed (confirmed 2026-09-30, resuming after the prior
session ended mid-pilot) -- so that's the current default. SURF has no
pressure-level dimension (7 vars x 1 level), so a full month (~5,200
fields) fetches fine at monthly granularity.

So: SURF is batched MONTHLY (~30x fewer requests than daily, proven to
work), PLEV is batched in 3-DAY chunks (~6,048 fields/request, proven to
work -- still ~2.5x fewer requests than daily). Both are merged into the
same yearly PLEV_{year}.nc / SURF_{year}.nc format the rest of the pipeline
already expects, via the same `cdo.mergetime` call TopoPyScale's own
retrieve_era5() uses -- so nothing downstream (downscale_climate's glob,
the symlink convention) needs to change.

Reuses TopoPyScale's own `unzip_file()` helper directly (identical CDS
zip-response handling) rather than reimplementing it. Also matches
TopoPyScale's own concurrency pattern for the actual requests: a thread
pool (`multiprocessing.dummy.Pool`, the same "ThreadPool" class
`retrieve_era5()` itself uses) submits several chunks to CDS at once
instead of waiting for each one's queue time sequentially -- each request
is I/O-bound (waiting on CDS), not CPU-bound, so threads (not processes)
are the right tool here, same as the library's own choice.
